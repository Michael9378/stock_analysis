for marking highs and lows
	start with date range you are looking for (say 15). Make sure date range is odd, otherwise round up to nearest odd
	from start, grab next 15 dates
	mark the high and low
	if high/low are the first floor(15/2), save as high/low
	move floor(15/2)+1 days onward (8)

alternatively to the date range, you are looking for "This date is the highest date within X days forward or backward"
In the above case, X is 7.
