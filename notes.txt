for marking highs and lows
	start with date range you are looking for (say 15). Make sure date range is odd, otherwise round up to nearest odd
	from start, grab next 15 dates
	mark the high and low
	if high/low are the first floor(15/2), save as high/low
	move floor(15/2)+1 days onward (8)

alternatively to the date range, you are looking for "This date is the highest date within X days forward or backward"
In the above case, X is 7.
	
----------------------------------------

Start by picking a low point
Make sure end point is between 10 and 30 days after low
Order next 10-30 days by highest values first
First point found by this ordering that has a slope of at least .5 is the winner

----------------------------------------

Need to find when to buy (pattern triggered) and when to exit (loss triggered)

When to buy: use clustering of previous data to look for patterns prior to run-ups
When to sell: When stock has dropped by X percent, where X is a 75% historical gaurentee that the stock won't return to that price within 5 days (differentiator between toe-kick and down-turn) or won't return in enough time to make .5% profit for 1 day slope possible..?

Within double bounded STD...
1.15 STD = 75% Confidence
1.20 STD = 77% Confidence
2.00 STD = 95% Confidence
